Introduction:
This Antivirus Scanner is a basic tool that can be used to scan a directory for potential virus infections. It works by searching for specific virus signatures within files in the given directory. If a file contains a virus signature, the program will prompt the user to delete the infected file.

Features:
Scans a specified directory for potential viruses.
Detects viruses based on predefined virus signatures.
Allows the user to delete infected files.

Usage:
Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.

Run the compiled program, and provide the directory path you want to scan.

The program will scan the directory for virus signatures in all files and display the results.

If a virus signature is found in a file, the program will prompt you to delete it. Press Enter to delete the file or any other key to skip.

The scan results will be displayed at the end of the process.

How it Works:
The Antivirus Scanner scans files in the specified directory by searching for predefined virus signatures within each file. If a virus signature is found, it prompts the user to delete the infected file. The program uses a simple text-based approach for virus signature matching.
